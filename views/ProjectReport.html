    <p>
        <span>Accomplished:</span>
        <ul>
            <li>We got the site up and worked through user stories that were either prerequisites or generally had a high value to end user vs. effort.</li>
            <li>We created a product backlog based on the project description.</li>
            <li>We estimated the effort for each of the backlog items.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <span>Challenges:</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Since it was fall break, and two of us were out of town most of the week, coordination became significantly more difficult.</li>
            <li>We noticed that we needed a simpler, more direct way to communicate in general, which we fixed by creating a slack group.</li>
            <li>Due to our vastly different levels of tech know-how, effort estimation proved to be tricky. Ultimately, we decided that we would not choose different amounts of effort depending on who the task was assigned to, but rather are OK with someone's velocity per week being 20 and someone else's being 5, i.e. that effort estimation does not reflect actual time spent and that's OK.</li>
            <li>Our current trajectory implies we will not finish in time.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <span>Roadblocks:</span>
        <ul>
            <li>None so far!</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <span>Before the next report we hope to:</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Since we completed 74 units of work this sprint, we hope to keep up this pace for the upcoming week at the very least.</li>
            <li>As we currently are not on track to complete everything by the end, we may try to speed up a little.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
