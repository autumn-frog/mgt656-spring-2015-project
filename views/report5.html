        <span>Product Backlog</span>
        
        <p>
            <span>The current backlog consists of 1 item, weighing in at an estimated 8 units of effort. However, we are still waiting for the other shoe to drop.</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Create and submit Final Sprint Report 6</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </p>

    <p>
        <span>Accomplished:</span>
        <ul>
            <li>We finished up all of our outstanding stories.</li>
            <li>We double-checked that everything passes the mocha tests.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <span>Challenges:</span>
        <ul>
            <li>We did run into some user issues with using the SSH approach to git with the keys, so some of us had to go back to using the HTTPS approach. We plan to see if we can fix this.</li>
            <li>This was the final (metaphorical) sprint in terms of stories, and we had no trouble knocking them out, so there were no real challenges this week.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <span>Roadblocks:</span>
        <ul>
            <li>None so far!</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <span>Before the next report we hope to:</span>
